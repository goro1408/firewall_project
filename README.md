# Python Firewall Simulator

This project is a simple firewall simulation in Python that captures network packets, filters them based on predefined rules, and logs blocked packets. It's built to demonstrate basic network security concepts and can be expanded for more complex filtering.

## Features
- Block packets based on IP address, port, and protocol.
- Log blocked packets to `blocked_packets.log`.
- Real-time packet capture and filtering using Scapy.

## Installation
